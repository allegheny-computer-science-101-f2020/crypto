## Description of the work already completed
A1Z26 - So far I have successfully created a method that will make
a letter a number. I am able to have the user enter in a certain string
and transfer it into a sequence of numbers separated by a hyphen.
While working on the method itself, I noticed that if the user entered 
String had an uppercase, the method would completely skip that index
and leave it empty. Fixing that, I made the method only take in lower 
case letter whenever it is entered.
## Description of the steps that you will take to finish the project
A1Z26 - I need to be able to implement another method that will make 
a number into a letter. I want to create a new private variable that 
will take a new array and hold 26 spots to represent the spots of the
alphabet.
