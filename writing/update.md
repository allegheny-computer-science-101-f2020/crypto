## Description of the work already completed
A1Z26 - So far I have successfully created a method that will make
a letter a number. I am able to have the user enter in a certain string
and transfer it into a sequence of numbers separated by a hyphen.
While working on the method itself, I noticed that if the user entered
String had an uppercase, the method would completely skip that index
and leave it empty. Fixing that, I made the method only take in lower
case letter whenever it is entered.

RailFenceCipher- so far i have established and initialized the
railFenceCipher.java file. the method has been set and all of
the needed steps to start the cipher have been made.
## Description of the steps that you will take to finish the project
A1Z26 - I need to be able to implement another method that will make
a number into a letter. I want to create a new private variable that
will take a new array and hold 26 spots to represent the spots of the
alphabet.

railFenceCipher- i still need to be able to call the function into the
main file and i need to finish writing the code to make it print out
and decode correctly.
