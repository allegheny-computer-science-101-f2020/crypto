# Writing Messages in Ciphers

## Lex Caldwell, Peter Snipes, Zackery Devers

## Description of the Main Idea
The main idea for this project is to be able to implement different
ciphers and have a user type in a message and the output will be their 
new message. 
## Description of the Tasks that You Will Complete
The end game for this project is to be able to put a user entered message and change it to
a ciphered message. The user will be able to choose which cipher they would 
like to use. For example, if the user chooses to have "Hello" written in A1Z26. The user will choose A1Z26
then type in their message: "Hello" and then the output will be " 8 5 11 11 15 ".
## Detailed Plan for Your Team to Complete the Project
This project will definitely have more than a few files just based on how many
ciphers we do. We will split the work up by having each of us work on implementing 
a different cipher and testing our code as we go. After we get most of our ciphers
done then we can create more test cases, to help further test the total 
functionality of our code. During lab sessions, we will look into our specific ciphers
and work and create different branches for each of us to work in without messing
another person up.
